## üßë‚Äçüíª Run the App Locally To use the BookFinder app on your own machine, follow these steps. Firebase Authentication and the Google Books API require the app to be served from a web server‚Äînot opened as a `file://` file. 

### üîΩ 1. Download or Clone the Project 

**Option A: Clone with Git**
```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookfinder.git cd bookfinder 
``` **Option B: Download ZIP** 

    1. Click the green **"Code"** button on the GitHub repository. 
    2. Select **Download ZIP**. 
    3. Extract the ZIP file to your computer. 
    4. Open the folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code). 
    
 
### üåê 2. Start a Local Web Server Opening `index.html` directly in the browser will not work correctly because Firebase Authentication does not support the `file://` protocol. Use one of these methods to serve the app locally: 

#### ‚úÖ Option A: Use Python (Built-in Web Server) If you have Python installed: ```bash # For Python 3.x python -m http.server 8000 ``` Then, open your browser and go to: ``` http://localhost:8000 ``` #### 

‚úÖ Option B: Use Live Server in VS Code 

1. Install the "Live Server" extension from the Extensions Marketplace. 
2. Open the project folder in VS Code. 
3. Open `index.html`. 
4. Right-click the file and choose **"Open with Live Server"**. 
5. The app will launch in your browser, usually at: ``` http://127.0.0.1:5500 

``` --- ### üìù 
3. Use the App - Use the search bar to look up books (by title, author, or keyword) - Sign in with Google to save books to your **Favorites** - Use the **filter** boxes to refine results or your saved favorites ‚ö†Ô∏è You must be online for Firebase and the Google Books API to function properly. --- ### üõ† 4. (Optional) Customize Firebase You can use your own Firebase project instead of the included one. 

Steps: 1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ 
2. Create a new project. 
3. Enable **Authentication ‚Üí Google Sign-In**. 
4. Create a **Firestore Database**. 
5. Replace the Firebase config inside the `<script>` tag in `index.html`: ```js const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com", projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", ... }; ```
